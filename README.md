# Habby

A basic habit tracker app created to experiment with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and
[Lacinia](http://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

My friend Aly ([GitHub](https://github.com/alythobani)) turned the experiment into an actual app ([his fork](https://github.com/alythobani/stay-habby)), check it out [here](https://stayhabby.com).
